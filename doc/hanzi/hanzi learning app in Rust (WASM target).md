# hanzi learning app in Rust (WASM target)

```
Good day

I'm starting to learn both Rust and Chinese now, and want to write my own portable training app with hanzi handwriting copybook (*). The problem I see for a first glance, most libraries was done for text inputting in a very relaxed style, where any drunken scribbles can be accepted as a valid input and converted into some probable hanzi set.

What I need is a training-targeted precision handwriting input, what tracks strokes position and order correctness (**). In an ideal case, it also should detect faults and highlight them.


Would anybody can point me on some libraries, resources and papers which I can use as a starting point for this `precision handwriting input` topic?


(*) as vocabulary training is already good in Trainchinese with my obsoleded Android 4 phone)
(**) for using in cases like vocabulary dictation
